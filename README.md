# Image Segmentation
This repository contains code for performing image segmentation, a computer vision task that partitions an image into multiple segments or regions based on certain criteria.

# Overview
Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that plays a crucial role in various applications such as medical image analysis, autonomous driving, object detection, and more. It involves dividing an image into meaningful parts or segments to simplify its representation and facilitate analysis.

# Features
Semantic Segmentation: Segment images into semantically meaningful regions corresponding to different object classes.
Instance Segmentation: Identify individual object instances within an image.
Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs): Utilize FCNs for pixel-level classification.
Deep Learning Models: Employ state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for accurate segmentation.
